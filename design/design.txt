This is design notes and to-dos for now

CURRENT MAIN TASKS
    - User Page
        - Remember to come back and deal with downloading of avatar images (going to have to cache these locally)
        - Why is the github URL getting populated when it doesn't exist?  (e.g., Ellen)
    - Sheet Consumption
    - Search
        - Need to handle single character searches right (check for disallowed strings)
    - TellusSource - Tellus' internal source to do its own setup functions
        - Ensure there are some basic Tells for things like 'go' etc.
    - Coverage - /tests/coverage/index.html


2020-10-10:
    In massive refactor, keeping some notes:
        - Need to update existing Tells based on Categories in Migration
        - Figure out last_updated bug (and maybe just put the info into the data dict) - think this was just the user issue

DNS
    - Check port 80 instead (in addition?) on load
    - Only reload every once in a while
    - Note last load, allow force?

GO
    -

TELLUS general
    NEXT
        - Fix DNS so that it removes unreachable DNS entries after some period of time
        - Consider whether to collapse Teller persistence into a parameter...
        - Create something like data migrations...and save file versioning
            - SAVE FILE VERSIONING
                - Migrations from prev file to this one?

        THINK ABOUT:  standard "value" items (e.g., alias) are easier to fill in templates
            'look for tellus-alias' anywhere
        Move other config into Vault
            e.g., Github key
            Create a configuration class
    ISSUES
        * Edit -> Delete is bad UI...add the delete/really? thing
        * TELLUS SHOULD NOT OVERWRITE DATA, EVER (currently sources will do so)
            x Source load should only be additive
            ? Maybe always put source values in source map?
            x Add source of "human" -> treats it as additive (Edit button?)
                ? Collapse TELLUS_HUMAN -> TELLUS_GO?
        - Fix queries/tellus category stuff (fully qualify categories)
    - Sources
        - Arbitrary adding of different types of sources
            - Confluence
            - Sheet (needs a bunch of config - to do sometime later)
        - aiohttp multiple threads?  Asyncify some of the lookups?
        - Prioritize updates of Tell data?  Right now it's basically last one wins...
        - Add "purge/reload" for non-human touched items
    Deployment
        - Have Tellus' deployment link to its logs?
    Tellicious
        - what kind of a tell is this?
            - no alias
            -
        - javascript
        - rss -> Slack?
    Feature Requests
        tellus tiles a la Jumpcloud
        CNAme -> A record mapping
    Tells
        - allow space delimited tags
        - Make persistence safer (crazy git idea, or some other versioning something something)
        - Look at creation persistence - I think happening outside of the Teller
            Maybe did this because DNS...think about timing
    Clean up the UI
        ? Auto-gen Tellus display page attributes from dict
        - Make prettier?  (use bootstrap theme?)
        - figure out Bootstrap validation
    Github Source
        - Add all repos
        - Give activity for the repo (sparkline of commits, people)
        - Edges
    Configuration
        - Move all of the stuff out to real config files
        - Need config file
    Slackbot
        - whatis (or just tellus?)
        - whois
    S/M
        - History?


- Validation

Features I'd like to add:
    - Magic tags (e.g., "Dashboard")

Replicate for Go:
javascript:q=location.href;if(document.getSelection){d=document.getSelection();}else{d='';};p=document.title;void(open('https://pinboard.in/add?url='+encodeURIComponent(q)+'&description='+encodeURIComponent(d)+'&title='+encodeURIComponent(p),'Pinboard','toolbar=no,width=700,height=350'));
javascript:q=location.href;if(document.getSelection){d=document.getSelection();}else{d='';};p=document.title;void(open('https://pinboard.in/add?url='+encodeURIComponent(q)+'&description='+encodeURIComponent(d)+'&title='+encodeURIComponent(p),'Pinboard','toolbar=no,width=700,height=350'));

OLD NOTES
---------
    # This is now handled a little more simply, but useful reminder...
    # Setting a debug email in the browser looks like this:
    # tellususer = "{\"created\": 1602255557\054 \"session\": {\"tellus_debug_email\": \"user@someserver.com\"\054 \"tellususer\": \"user\"}}"
